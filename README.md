Stephanie Lonsdale AI Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! My name is Stephanie Lonsdale, I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (graduating August 2026). I'm passionate about building real-world AI systems from classical machine learning to generative models, RAG pipelines, and Responsible AI evaluation tools. 

My work focuses on practical, scalable, human-centered AI, with my graduate experience spanning: 

- Retrieval-augmented generation
- NLP and LLM applications
- Generative modeling (GANS, VAEs)
- Deep learning with PyTorch
- Data science and classical ML
- Responsible AI, safety evaluation, and bias analysis
- End-toend applied ML projects

This portfolio highlights selected projects I've built through coursework, independent research, and self-guided experimentation.

Featured Projects: 

1. Email Summarization and Auto-Response Generator (LLM-NLP)
A generative AI system that summarizes long email threads and drafts intelligent responses.
Built using HuggingFace models, OpenAI APIs, retrieval components, and prompt optimization.
